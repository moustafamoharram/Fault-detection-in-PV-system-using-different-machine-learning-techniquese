Fault Detection in Photovoltaic Systems

Bachelor Thesis - German University in Cairo

This project presents a machine learning approach to detect and localize faults in photovoltaic (PV) systems, addressing critical issues like efficiency loss and potential damage. Using MATLAB-Simulink, I simulated various fault scenarios and trained multiple classifiers — KNN, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, and Random Forest — to identify line-to-line, open-circuit, and degradation faults.

The models were evaluated based on accuracy with test data, external data, and complex fault cases. The Random Forest classifier achieved the best overall performance, with over 99% accuracy in test and external data, and full accuracy in detecting double faults.

Key features:
	•	Simulation Setup: A PV array with 6 strings of 5 modules, tested under varying irradiance and temperature conditions.
	•	Fault Types: Line-to-line faults, open-circuit faults, degradation faults.
	•	Machine Learning Models: KNN, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, Random Forest.
	•	Performance: Up to 99.09% accuracy, with real-time fault detection potential.

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in renewable energy systems, aiming to improve PV system reliability and maintenance efficiency. Future work includes expanding fault coverage and testing with real-world data.
